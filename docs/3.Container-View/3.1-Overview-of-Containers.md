    * Acts as the primary user interface for customers, agents, and administrators.
    * Communicates with the backend services via API Gateway.
    * Provides features like balance inquiries, fund transfers, bill payments, etc.
2. **API Gateway:**
    * The central point of communication between the frontend (Mobile App) and backend services.
    * Manages routing, authentication, and load balancing.
    * Ensures security by validating API requests and enforcing throttling policies.
3. **Microservices:**
    * Modular, independent services responsible for specific domains like user data, transactions, agent records, notifications, etc.
    * Each service has its own responsibilities, ensuring that the system is scalable, maintainable, and flexible.

    * Acts as the central data storage system.
    * Stores persistent information such as user profiles, transaction records, tenant information, and notifications.
