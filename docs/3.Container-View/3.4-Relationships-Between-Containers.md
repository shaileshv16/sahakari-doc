The Sahakari App's containers interact with each other to provide seamless functionality, from user interface to external transaction processing. Below is a breakdown of how these containers communicate and their relationships:

***

#### **1\. Mobile App ↔ API Gateway**

* **Mobile App (Frontend)** communicates with the **API Gateway** to send user requests and receive responses. These requests include actions such as balance inquiries, transactions, bill payments, and more.
* The **API Gateway** acts as a gatekeeper, routing requests from the mobile app to the appropriate microservice based on the type of request.

**Relationship:**

* **Mobile App:** Sends API requests for user actions (e.g., balance inquiry, fund transfer).
* **API Gateway:** Receives these requests, authenticates them, and forwards them to the correct backend service (e.g., Banking Service, User Service).

***

#### **2\. API Gateway ↔ Microservices**

* The **API Gateway** routes the requests it receives from the **Mobile App** to the respective microservice. Each microservice handles a specific set of business functionalities.
    * **User Service:** Handles requests related to user authentication, profile management, and registration.
    * **Banking Service:** Processes financial transactions such as internal transfers, NEFT, and RTGS.
    * **Tenant Service:** Retrieves branch-specific data and manages tenant configurations.
    * **Pigmy Agent Service:** Handles agent-specific activities, such as pigmy collection.
    * **SMS Service:** Sends notifications, OTPs, and alerts through the integrated SMS gateway or Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).

**Relationship:**

* **API Gateway:** Routes requests to specific microservices based on the action (e.g., login to User Service, fund transfer to Banking Service).
* **Microservices:** Respond with the relevant data (e.g., successful transaction or user authentication token) back to the API Gateway, which forwards the response to the Mobile App.

***

#### **3\. Microservices ↔ Database**

* Each **Microservice** interacts with the **Database** to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations:
    * **User Service** stores and retrieves user profiles, authentication details, and session information.
    * **Banking Service** stores transaction records and retrieves account balances and transaction histories.
    * **Tenant Service** manages tenant and branch-specific data.
    * **Pigmy Agent Service** stores agent-related transaction data.
    * **SMS Service** logs notifications and alerts sent to users.

**Relationship:**

* **Microservices:** Perform data operations on the database, such as fetching user data for login, retrieving balance information for inquiry, or storing transaction logs.
* **Database:** Provides persistent storage for all data entities required by the microservices (user profiles, transaction logs, tenant data).

***

#### **4\. Microservices ↔ External Services**

* Some **Microservices** directly communicate with **External Services** (APIs) to perform specific operations:
    * **Banking Service** interacts with the **NEFT/RTGS API** to facilitate interbank fund transfers.
    * **Banking Service** also integrates with the **BBPS API** for bill payments and the **Mobile Recharge API** for processing mobile recharges.
    * **SMS Service** connects with an **SMS Gateway** to send out transaction alerts, OTPs, and other notifications.

**Relationship:**

* **Microservices (Banking, SMS):** Call external services to execute tasks like fund transfers, bill payments, or sending notifications.
* **External Services (APIs):** Process the request and return a response (e.g., successful transaction, SMS delivered) back to the microservices, which relay this information to the **Mobile App** via the **API Gateway**.

***

#### **5\. Mobile App ↔ External Services \(Indirect\)**

* While the **Mobile App** doesn’t interact directly with **External Services**, users perform actions like fund transfers (via NEFT/RTGS) or bill payments (via BBPS) through the app.
* These actions trigger requests to the **API Gateway**, which forwards them to the corresponding **Microservice**, which, in turn, interacts with the **External Service**.

**Relationship:**

* **Mobile App:** Indirectly interacts with external services by initiating actions like payments and transfers.
* **API Gateway and Microservices:** Handle the actual communication with external APIs to fulfill user requests.
