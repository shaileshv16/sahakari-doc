## Key Design Decisions

1. **Microservice Architecture:**
    * Each major function (user management, banking, notifications) is handled by an independent service, improving modularity and scalability.
2. **API Gateway for Routing:**
    * The API Gateway serves as a centralized entry point, managing all client requests securely and ensuring proper load distribution.
3. **External API Integration:**
    * The app leverages established banking APIs (NEFT, RTGS, BBPS) for reliable external transactions, rather than building proprietary systems.
4. **Security and Authentication:**
    * User data and transactions are protected with secure authentication, authorization protocols, and encryption standards.
5. **Scalability and Performance:**
    * The system is designed to scale horizontally, particularly the microservices and the API Gateway, to handle growing user traffic.
