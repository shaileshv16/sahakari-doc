## Internal Communication between Components

* The **Mobile App** communicates with the **API Gateway** via RESTful API calls.
* The **API Gateway** routes requests to specific microservices (e.g., User Service, Banking Service) based on the request type.
* **Microservices** communicate with the **Database** to fetch or update records (e.g., for transactions or user profiles).
* For external transactions like NEFT or bill payments, the **Banking Service** interacts with external APIs (e.g., NEFT/RTGS, BBPS).
* Notifications are sent through the **SMS Service**, which communicates with external **SMS Gateway** APIs.
